### 🧠 About Me

I'm a Full Stack Developer and AI Engineer with hands-on experience building scalable systems, responsive user interfaces, and applied machine learning tools. My work spans industries—from e-commerce and education to mental health and game development.

I’ve contributed to enterprise apps using Spring Boot, developed cross-platform interfaces with React Native, and architected secure backends with Django, Node.js, and Flask. With a background in both frontend finesse and backend muscle, I thrive in collaborative environments that value code quality and continuous improvement.

Currently pursuing a Full Stack Fellowship at Pursuit, where I continue to sharpen my skills in JavaScript, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and deployment pipelines.
